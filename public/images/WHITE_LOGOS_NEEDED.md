# White Logo Files Needed

The following white logo versions are needed for better visibility on dark backgrounds or when the current logos are hard to see:

## Required Files:
1. **avalanche-logo-white.png** - Solid white version of the Avalanche Robotics logo
2. **everest-logo-white.png** - Solid white version of the Everest Robotics logo

## Usage Locations:
- Dark background sections
- Overlay images where logos need better contrast
- Footer (if using dark theme)
- Navigation (if using dark theme)
- Any place where current logos have poor visibility

## Current Logo Locations:
- `/public/images/avalanche-logo.png` - Current Avalanche logo
- `/public/images/everest-logo.png` - Current Everest logo

Once these white logo files are added, update the code to use them conditionally based on background color or context.
